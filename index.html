						<h1>What Is It?</h1>
						<p>Individuality is having differences between you and everyone around you. Complex is the erratic behavior and characteristics of the mind or person. Together, it is having a lack of difference between you and those that appear around us. When it is put into simple context, we see it around us all the time, however just not extreme. People are given titles that define them, however others tries to group them as being the same. That is one of the most minor examples.</p>

						<h1>Good or Bad?</h1>
						<p>When taken into extreme context, individuality complex is the backend of some of the worst events in all history. It is the cause of manifest destiny, it was the holocaust, it is communism, it is imperialism, etc. However we've taken actions to learn about history in order to not let itself repeat. In this complex's lightest form it can be seen as a way of our connnection between eachother. It's when people say <b>'we're all the same'</b>, and they are not wrong. Both can be used to express direct opposite claims, so you can't necessarily say if it is good or bad.</p>

						<h1>Deeper Examples</h1>
						<p>In 1944, the Holocaust had reached a stage of concentration camps. Every single Jewish person would be subjected to harsh punishment for a crime they did not commit. First, they were given numbers, then the Nazis required them to have the same names, and lastly, they were all slaughtered like pigs. Another example is Hernan Cortes and his imperialism over the Aztecs and Nahua cultures of what is now Mexico. Manifest destiny was his extreme way of forcing them to either learn Spanish and become Catholic, or to be murdered. These are two extreme examples of individuality complex.</p>
